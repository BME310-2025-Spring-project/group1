# Project Scope - Smart Hospital Pre-Registration System

## Project Description
The Smart Hospital Pre-Registration System aims to create an accessible web and mobile platform where patients can pre-register for hospital services, verify their insurance coverage beforehand, and schedule appointments. This system is designed to reduce hospital waiting times, prevent financial misunderstandings caused by insurance issues, and enhance patient satisfaction in both public and private hospitals.

## Core Modules
- **Patient Registration Module**: Allows patients to input personal information, insurance details, and necessary documents.
- **Insurance Verification Module**: Verifies the patient's insurance eligibility using either real-time databases or simulated checks.
- **Appointment Scheduling Module**: Enables patients to choose hospital services, select doctors, and book appointments after successful registration and insurance verification.
- **Administrative Management Panel (Optional)**: Provides hospital staff a panel to manage patient pre-registrations, insurance statuses, and scheduled appointments.

## Assumptions
- Patients have access to a smartphone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection.
- Hospitals are willing to cooperate and integrate or simulate basic insurance validation.
- Basic insurance rules can be simulated without real-time API integration.

## Limitations
- Real-time connections to government or private insurance APIs will be simulated and not live.
- Online payment functionality is excluded from the project scope.
- Detailed electronic health record (EHR) management will not be included.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Patients**: End-users registering for services and managing appointments.
- **Hospital Staff**: Personnel handling registrations and appointments internally.
- **Insurance Providers**: Entities whose coverage eligibility is verified (simulated).
