The goal of this project is to develop a web-based and mobile-accessible platform that allows patients to pre-register for hospital services, verify their insurance coverage, and avoid miscommunication or unnecessary costs.

The system aims to reduce waiting times, prevent financial disputes due to insurance misunderstandings, and streamline the patient admission process in both public and private hospitals.
